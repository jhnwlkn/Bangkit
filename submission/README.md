# Air Quality Control Dashboard

## Overview

This Streamlit dashboard provides visualizations for air quality control data, allowing users to explore and analyze various air pollutants at different monitoring stations.

## Requirements

To run this dashboard, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Running the Dashboard
Once you have the required libraries installed, you can run the Streamlit dashboard using the following command:

streamlit run dashboard.py

This command will launch the dashboard in your default web browser. You can explore the air quality control visualizations and analyze the data.

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide):

Highest: Wanshouxigong with a mean of 17.15
Lowest: Huairou with a mean of 12.12

2. NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):

Highest: Wanliu with a mean of 65.26
Lowest: Dingling with a mean of 27.59

3. CO (Carbon Monoxide):

Highest: Wanliu with a mean of 1370.40
Lowest: Dingling with a mean of 904.90

4. O3 (Ozone):

Highest: Dingling with a mean of 68.55
Lowest: Wanliu with a mean of 48.87

5. Pollution Levels (Combined):

Highest: Wanshouxigong with a mean of 374.83
Lowest: Dingling with a mean of 253.19

Max and Min Temperature Levels per Station:

This visualization displays the maximum and minimum temperature levels recorded at each station.
For each visualization, a corresponding image has been provided in the repository. The images are named as follows:

SO2: SO2.png
NO2: NO2.png
CO: CO.png
O3: O3.png
Pollution Levels: pollutant_level.png
Max and Min Temperature: max_min_temperature.png
